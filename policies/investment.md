This policy statement supports Noran Energy’s over-arching Corporate Responsibility Policy.

In fostering positive external relationships with communities, governments, NGOs, investors and other stakeholders interested in and affected by our operations, Noran Energy will:

- Maintain timely, constructive and transparent ongoing engagement with all stakeholders
- Treat neighbours with respect and understanding, acknowledging community governance and seeking free and informed consent prior to initiating operations that have a potentially significant social impact on the community
- Work to achieve a net positive socio-economic impact on local communities, promoting opportunities which enhance sustainable benefit
- Support the socio-economic sustainability and wellbeing of communities through local procurement and other engagement with local business
- Invest in well-planned social projects that support the development priorities of host communities and governments, and seek to ensure that these are implemented in a way that leads to enduring benefit
- Provide fair and adequate compensation for any losses for which we are liable
- Provide local communities’ access to appropriate grievance mechanisms
- Encourage joint venture partners to adopt the principles in this policy
