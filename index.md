Noran Energy is an Oil and Gas Engineering Management Company providing cost effective and innovative development solutions to the Oil and Gas sector. We primarily focus on providing solutions to allow operators to commercialize their marginal fields, but we can apply the same skill set to rejuvenate existing fields.

Operating from Stavanger, Norway, we have access to a vast network of Oil and Gas specialists allowing us to tap into the latest advancements in the Oil and Gas industry. Noran Energy's core team can provide full engineering and commercial expertise in the overall field development from reservoir, drilling, subsea through to facilities and offloading.

Noran Energy is now aiming to partner with investors to create a new independent Oil and Gas company. With a solid track record of developing marginal fields, we believe we can provide an immediate opportunity for any investor wishing to take advantage of the current economic climate in the Oil and Gas sector.
