In the past two years, our team has been providing engineering services and looking at different options for development of a marginal oil field in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. 

Several concepts and combinations of drilling, well completion, subsea and production facilities were screened during this time, recommending a final solution for development of this reservoir in a technically and commercially challenging environment.

Successful delivery of this project will be a testimonial to innovative thinking and comprehensive skills of our team.

Noran Energy is looking forward to harnessing these skills further, in development of other challenging reservoirs globally. We strive to achieve safest and the most cost effective solution.
