# Risk Management Policy

Noran Energy is committed to continuously improve its approach to risk management across the organization. The objectives of Risk Management in Noran Energy are to ensure:

- Quality of our decision making and planning
- Learning from and resilience to changing events, incidents and crises
- Effective identification, evaluation and analysis of uncertainty
- Compliance, stakeholder confidence and trust
- Increased likelihood of achieving our business objectives
- People and our assets are safeguarded and protected

To achieve these we will:

- Seek to identify & evaluate risks associated with all aspects of our business including those risks to which we might be exposed by others with whom we work or do business
- Set standards for Risk Appetite which for avoidance of doubt will never compromise our HS&E policy & standards
- Adopt a risk management framework based on IS0 31000/31100 Risk Management- Principles and Guidelines
- Develop and implement appropriate responses, accountabilities and actions to control and mitigate risks
- Allocate appropriate resources for risk identification and actions to control and mitigate risk
- Test the achievement of Risk Appetite standards at key decision points
- Assure that the necessary risk controls and mitigating measures are effective

In Noran energy we believe risk management is just good management. It is the responsibility of everybody involved in Noran Energy to comply with our Policies and to assist in their implementation.
