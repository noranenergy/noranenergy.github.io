Noran Energy operates from the Norwegian Oil and Gas capital, Stavanger.

Our business model is to generate value by using our core multi-discipline team combined with their diverse entrepreneurial skills to provide innovative Oil and Gas development and production solutions. This allows operators to:

- Develop their marginal fields within project economic metrics
- Enhance oil production from their producing reservoirs
- Focus on their core business while we provide engineering, cost and procurement management through each phase of development to execution and first production

Our service across the full development portfolio includes:

- Reservoir assessment
- Drilling and completion solutions
- Subsea development
- Production facility
- Oil export solutions
- Construction management
- Accurate cost models

We are actively seeking opportunities to develop oil fields which are currently uneconomic, where we believe we can create value and unlock stranded assets using our core skills.
